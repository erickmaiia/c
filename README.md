This repository was created as part of my journey to learn the C language. Here, I document my progress as I familiarize myself with the basic concepts of the language and begin to explore more advanced topics such as pointers.

## What You'll Find in This Repository:

- **Examples of Basic Structures:** I share code examples that demonstrate how to use basic C language constructs, such as variable declaration, arithmetic and logical operators, among others.

- **Loop Repetition:** Explore examples of how to use different types of loops in C, including `for`, `while`, and `do-while`, to create iterations in your code.

- **Control Structures:** Learn about the different control structures available in C, such as `if`, `else`, `switch`, and how to use them to control the flow of your program.

- **Introduction to Pointers:** As I progress in my learning journey, I share my findings and challenges when working with pointers in C. Pointers are a fundamental and powerful feature of the language, and here I will document my progress as I master them.
