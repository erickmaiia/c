Choosing the best data structure to implement a stack in C depends on the specific context of the problem at hand. However, in general, I prefer to implement a stack using a linked list in C.

The linked list has the advantage of allowing the insertion and removal of elements in constant time, regardless of the stack size. Additionally, the linked list can be easily dynamically resized during program execution, allowing the stack to grow or shrink as needed. This is especially useful if the maximum stack size is not known in advance or if the stack needs to be dynamically resized to meet the requirements of the problem.

Furthermore, the linked list is easy to implement in C and consumes less memory than an array-based stack, as it does not require a fixed memory space to store the entire stack. In a linked list, each node stores only one element and a pointer to the next node in the list, saving memory space.

So for most use cases I would choose to implement a stack using a linked list in C.
